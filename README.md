A service to shorten your URLs

I plan to blog after a suggestion from Kurtis Pykes, a very popular data science writer on Medium. There is actually an article already on me in the style that I want to write but the link to the site is too long. I want to shorten it but I know there are issues with popular services so I will make my own shortener. Beyond myself, many social media marketing departments need to advertise with shortened links. Often however, they post unnecessarily long links which people are not willing to click on or trust. This can potentially hurt branding before users even see the product.
