A service to shorten your URLs

I plan to blog after a suggestion from Kurtis Pykes. There is actually an article already on me in the style that I want to write but link to the site is too long. I want to shorten it but I know there are issues with popular services so I will make my own shortener.

Technologies:
Backend Routing: Flask
Database: Redis
